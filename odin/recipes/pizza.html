<h3>How to make it</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
     Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in your pizza recipe. This is typically around 450-500°F (230-260°C) for home ovens.</li>
    <li>Prepare the dough: Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness and shape. Transfer the dough to a pizza stone, baking sheet, or pizza pan that has been lightly greased or dusted with cornmeal to prevent sticking.</li>
    <li> 
     Add the sauce: Spread a layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
    <li>  
     Add the cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese (or your cheese of choice) evenly over the sauce.</li>
    <li> 
    Add toppings: Arrange your desired toppings on top of the cheese. Be mindful not to overload the pizza with too many toppings, as this can make it difficult to cook through properly.</li>
    <li> 
    Bake the pizza: Carefully transfer the prepared pizza to the preheated oven and bake for approximately 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted.
    <li> 
    Finish with herbs and seasoning: Once the pizza is out of the oven, you can sprinkle it with additional herbs and seasonings such as dried oregano, basil, red pepper flakes, or garlic powder for extra flavor.</li>
    <li>
    Slice and serve: Allow the pizza to cool for a few minutes, then slice it into portions and serve hot.    </li>
