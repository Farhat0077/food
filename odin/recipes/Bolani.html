    <h3>How to make it ?</h3>
       <li>Make the dough:<br>
           - In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt.
           - Gradually add water while kneading the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Prepare the filling: <br>
           - In a separate bowl, mix the mashed potatoes, chopped onion, minced garlic, ground coriander, ground cumin, and salt. Ensure the filling is thoroughly combined and seasoned to taste.</li>
       <li> Assemble the bolani: <br>
           - Divide the dough into several small balls. On a floured surface, roll out each ball into a thin, circular disc.</li>
        
       <li> Add the filling: <br>
           - Place a portion of the prepared filling onto one half of the rolled-out dough, leaving space around the edges.</li>

        <li>Seal the bolani: <br>
            - Fold the other half of the dough over the filling to form a half-moon shape. Press the edges firmly to seal them</li>
         <li>Fry the bolani: <br>
            - In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the bolani and fry until golden brown on both sides.</li>
        <li>Serve: <br>
            - Remove the bolani from the skillet and place it on paper towels to drain any excess oil. Cut the bolani into wedges and serve with a side of plain yogurt or a dipping sauce of your choice.</li>
