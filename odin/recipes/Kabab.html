<h3>How to make it ?</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare the marinade: <br>
        - In a bowl, combine the chopped onion, minced garlic, plain yogurt, olive oil, ground coriander, ground cumin, ground turmeric, paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix the ingredients thoroughly to form a smooth marinade.</li>
    <li>Marinate the lamb: <br>
        - Place the lamb cubes in the marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Cover the bowl and marinate the meat for at least 2-4 hours, or preferably overnight, in the refrigerator to allow the flavors to permeate the meat.</li>
    <li>Skewer the lamb: <br>
        - Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Thread the marinated lamb cubes onto the soaked skewers, ensuring an even distribution of meat on each skewer.</li>
    <li>Grill the kebabs: <br>
        - Place the skewers on the preheated grill and cook the kebabs for approximately 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the meat is charred on the outside and cooked to the desired level of doneness.</li>
    <li>Serve: <br>
        - Once grilled to perfection, remove the kebabs from the heat and allow them to rest for a few minutes. Serve the succulent lamb kebabs with a side of naan bread, rice, or a fresh salad for a truly delightful and satisfying meal.</li>
